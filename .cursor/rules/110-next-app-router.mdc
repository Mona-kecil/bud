- Default to Server Components. Add 'use client' only when React state/effects or browser APIs are required.
- Data fetching: prefer server-side fetch in Server Components or Route Handlers.
- Forms/actions: prefer Server Actions over client-only handlers when possible.
- Avoid legacy Pages Router patterns. Keep file-based routing idiomatic for App Router.
