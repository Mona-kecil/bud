- Prefer utility-first classes directly in JSX; keep className strings stable and readable.
- Use semantic HTML and accessible patterns; avoid purely visual div wrappers when landmarks exist.
- Avoid inline style when a Tailwind utility exists; use inline style only for dynamic CSS not representable by utilities.
- Use @apply sparingly in dedicated CSS files for repeated patterns, not inside components.
- If a cn/clsx helper exists, use it to compose conditional className values.
- Keep design tokens consistent with tailwind.config; do not invent arbitrary values if a token exists.
