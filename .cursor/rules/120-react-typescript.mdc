- Component names: PascalCase; file naming separated with "-" character.
- Props: define exported interface/type; avoid any; provide explicit return types for exported functions.
- Hooks: call at top-level; obey exhaustive-deps; extract complex effects into helpers.
- Events: type React handlers precisely (e.g., React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>).
- Keep components focused; lift state up; prefer composition over prop drilling.
- Prefer controlled inputs; memoize expensive derived values with useMemo and callbacks with useCallback when necessary.
