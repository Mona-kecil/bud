- Always propose a brief plan, then execute edits atomically.
- Make the smallest viable change; avoid refactors unless requested or required.
- Do not reformat unrelated code or reorder imports unless necessary for the change.
- Preserve existing conventions, naming, and folder structure.
- Use the project's package manager: pnpm.
- After substantive code edits, prefer: pnpm typecheck, pnpm lint, pnpm build. Fix failures before proceeding.
- Never write secrets into source; use env vars and existing config patterns.
- Keep commit scopes small and meaningful.
- When unsure about framework choice (server vs client, data layer, router), prefer the dedicated framework rules in this folder.
