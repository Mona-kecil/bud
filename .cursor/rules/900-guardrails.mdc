- Do not modify generated files (e.g., convex/_generated/**) or lockfiles unless explicitly requested.
- Avoid broad refactors across multiple files in a single step; prefer small, testable changes.
- Do not change TypeScript, Tailwind, or Next.js config files unless the task requires it.
- Maintain API contracts and public types when editing shared libraries; treat them as stable.
- Preserve lint and formatting configs; do not rewrite unrelated sections.
- When deleting code, confirm it is unused and provide a minimal rationale in the edit description.
