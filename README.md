## Currently available features:

## Roadmap
- Account page to track multiple money source (bank, e-wallet, cash, etc)
- Make each transaction type-safe by defining the source of money used on the transaction
- Dashboard that shows:
    - This month's 5 latest spending
    - This month's budget status
    - MoM budget summary (planned vs actualized)
- History feature to see last month's budget status and detailed transactions
- Parse bank transaction info from gmail to automate this tedious task.
